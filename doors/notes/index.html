<h1>&emsp;ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>
<h2>&emsp;To all admins:</h2>
<p>&emsp;Due to users abusing an 'IDOR' vulnerability, I am asking one of you to create a firewall and keep them away from our secret door.</p>
<p>- A</p>
<br>
<p>Should be fixed now. Implemented some js that goes as follows:</p>
<p>&emsp;-split query string into two parts: before the equal sign and after</p>
<p>&emsp;-don't return flag if the last part is [REDACTED]</p>
<p>This is very secure and there is no way to trick the firewall into allowing access.</p>
<p>- N</p>
